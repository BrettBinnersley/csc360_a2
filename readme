Assignment #2


My assignment does not follow my design spec uploaded to connex (Part 1 of the assignment) due to the fact that there were <major> errors in it.
I have redone the document design and submitted it at the bottom of this readme.
All the .c files state (roughly) what they do at the top.

To build
make

to run
./pqs <FILENAME>
